# SENSA: Software Entity Name Suggestion Apparatus

SENSA is a lightweight software entity name recommendation based on source code similarity measures. A majority of source code tokens are identifiers chose by programmers. To achieve high readability and understandability, assigning appropriate names to software entities, including methods, classes, and namespaces, is essential. Our tool provides a set of solutions for recommending good names for entities in the Java program. Currently, we have focused on recommending method names based on source code similarity across projects.
